## Before you start

For a substantial feature or behavior change, open an issue describing the problem and proposed direction first. Small bug fixes, tests, and documentation improvements can go directly to a pull request.

By contributing, you agree that your contribution is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.

```powershell

## Pull requests

- Keep changes focused and explain the user-visible outcome.
- Add or update tests for changed behavior.
- Do not commit API keys, OAuth files, email data, audio recordings, logs, models, generated executables, or build output.
- Preserve the local-first behavior of basic transcription.
- Make cloud-provider behavior explicit in the UI and documentation.
- Avoid logging credentials, raw audio, Gmail bodies, or other sensitive content.
- Update privacy and third-party notices when adding a service or dependency.

## Provider integrations

New AI providers should be isolated behind a small provider interface, use user-supplied credentials, expose clear failure messages, and be testable without live network calls. Unit tests must mock provider connections and must never consume paid API credits.

## Reporting security issues

Do not publish vulnerabilities or leaked credentials in a public issue. Follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
